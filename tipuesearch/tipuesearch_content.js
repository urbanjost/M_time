In addition, it can manipulate or read many other date representations … Julian Dates Unix Epoch Dates High-level date formatting Ordinal days of the year days of the week ISO-8601 week numbers month and weekday names Julian and Unix Epoch Dates are particularly useful for\nmanipulating dates in simple numeric expressions. They are numbers with\nunits of days and seconds respectively from a fixed date that you can\neasily convert to and from. So you can convert any date to a Julian Date,\nsubtract one and you have the date for yesterday, for example. The M_time Fortran module complements the DATE_AND_TIME(3f) procedure\n( it is the standard Fortran intrinsic subroutine that returns the\ncurrent date and time in the Gregorian calendar). That is, the primary\nway this module represents dates is as an integer array with the same\nmeaning for elements as defined by the DATE_AND_TIME(3f) routine. The extensive formatting options include showing SYSTEM_CLOCK(3f) and CPU_USAGE(3f) information along with Gregorian date information,\nallowing for the easy incorporation of timing information into program\nmessages. In addition to conventional Civilian Calendar dates, the module supports\nthe ISO-8601 standard. Both a procedural and OOP (Object Oriented Programming) interface are\nprovided. Each routine is accompanied by a man(1) page which includes a sample\nprogram for that procedure. An HTML manual, the source, and example\nprograms are included in the package.

With no options it displays allowed formats. For example: ./now year month day\n      ./now 'julian epoch ordinal'\n      ./now 'The year is %Y and the month is %M (%L) %h:%m:%s'\n      ./now formal\n\n       20200105\n       2458854 1578240100 005\n       The year is 2020 and the month is 01 (January) 11:01:39\n       The 5th of January 2020 Definitions A “date_and_time” array “DAT” has the same format as the array of\nvalues generated by the Fortran intrinsic DATE_AND_TIME(3f). That is,\nit is an 8-element integer array containing year, month, day, Time zone\ndifference from UTC in minutes, hour, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds\nof the second. This array represents a date on the Proleptic Gregorian\nCalendar. The Proleptic Gregorian Calendar assumes the Gregorian Calendar\nexisted back to the beginning of the Julian Day calendar (4713 BC). This\nmeans historic dates will often be confused, as the Julian Calendar was\nused in the USA until 1752-09-03, for example. The Gregorian Calendar was\nformally decreed on 1582-10-15 but was not adapted in many countries. The\nJulian Calendar was first used around 45 BC. Note that the Proleptic\nGregorian Calendar includes a year zero (0). It is frequently used in\ncomputer software to simplify the handling of older dates. For example,\nit is the calendar used by MySQL, SQLite, PHP, CIM, Delphi, Python and\nCOBOL. The Proleptic Gregorian Calendar is explicitly required for all\ndates before 1582 by ISO 8601:2004 (clause 4.3.2.1 The Gregorian calendar)\nif the partners to information exchange agree. Unix Epoch Time (UET) is defined as the number of seconds since\n00:00:00 on January 1st. 1970, UTC. A JED is defined as a Julian Ephemeris Date . JED days start at\nnoon (not at midnight). 4713-01-01 BC at noon is defined as JED 0.0. If you are not familiar with them, in this context Julian Dates and Unix\nEpoch Times are scalar numbers that allow for easy computations using\ndates (to go back one day just subtract one from a Julian Date, for\nexample). Since these values are generally not considered intelligible,\nroutines are included to convert between these scalar values and the\ndate array so human-readable results can be obtained. Coordinated Universal Time (French: Temps universel coordonn’\be),\nabbreviated as UTC , is the primary time standard by which the world\nregulates clocks and time. It is within about 1 second of mean solar\ntime at 0o longitude;[1] it does not observe daylight saving time. It\nis one of several closely related successors to Greenwich Mean Time\n(GMT). For most purposes, UTC is considered interchangeable with GMT,\nbut GMT is no longer precisely defined by the scientific community. Limitations Like most collections of date and time procedures M_time is not a\nhigh- precision library that accounts internally for leap seconds and\nrelativistic effects. M_time(3f) is intended for use in the recent era and is not appropriate\nfor use with historical dates that used some other calendar scheme such\nas the Julian Calendar. That is, you have to remember to account for\nconversions to other calendar systems when using historical dates. When Daylight Savings is in effect calculations will generally be correct,\nas the date model includes a timezone value; but you are responsible for\nensuring dates you create use the correct timezone value or otherwise\naccount for Daylight Savings Time as needed. Currently, dates are manipulated using the current system timezone, which\ncan typically be set using the environment variable TZ. So if you desire\nto set the default timezone you generally set the environment variable before executing your program. This is compatible with current observed\nbehavior for the intrinsic procedure DATE_AND_TIME(3f) with compilers I\nhave tested with, but does not seem to be a specified behavior as far as\nthe standard is concerned. That is, DATE_AND_TIME(3f) returns a vector\nthat contains a current time zone, but does not specify how a current\ntime zone can be explicitly set.  Since this library is intentionally\ndesigned to complement DATE_AND_TIME(3f) it adopts the same behavior. See Also The ISO-8601 standard is often used for business-related transactions. There are (of course) the C/C++ intrinsics which provide much of the same\nfunctionality that should be bindable to Fortran via the ISO_C_BINDING\nmodule. If you are looking for a high-precision Fortran library that is well\ntested for manipulating dates I would suggest looking at the NASA\nSPICElib library.  If you care about Leap Seconds, Orbital Mechanics,\nGPS/Satellite communications, and Astronomy it is worth a look. The Fortran Wiki fortranwiki.org contains\ninformation on other libraries and modules that provide date-time\nprocedures. References Gregorian Calendar(Wikipedia) Developer Info John S.

Note that technically the four states (new, first quarter, full, third\n   quarter) are events not phases. That is to say, the moon is technically\n   only new for an instant.

It is used (mainly) in\n   government and business for fiscal years, as well as in timekeeping.\n   The system specifies a week year atop the Gregorian calendar by defining\n   a notation for ordinal weeks of the year. o An ISO week-numbering year (also called ISO year informally) has 52\n     or 53 full weeks. That is 364 or 371 days instead of the usual 365\n     or 366 days.\n   o The extra week is referred to here as a leap week, although ISO-8601\n     does not use this term.  Weeks start with Monday.\n   o The first week of a year is the week that contains the first Thursday\n     of the year (and, hence, always contains 4 January).  ISO week year\n     numbering therefore slightly deviates from the Gregorian for some days\n     close to January 1st. CALCULATION The ISO-8601 week number of any date can be calculated, given its\n   ordinal date (i.e. position within the year) and its day of the week. METHOD Using ISO weekday numbers ( running from 1 for Monday to 7 for Sunday ) , subtract the weekday from the ordinal date , then add 10 . Divide the result by 7 . Ignore the remainder ; the quotient equals the week number . If the week number thus obtained equals 0 , it means that the given date belongs to the preceding ( week - based ) year . If a week number of 53 is obtained , one must check that the date is not actually in week 1 of the following year . These two statements are assumed true when correcting the dates around January 1 st : o The number of weeks in a given year is equal to the corresponding week number of 28 December . o January 4 th is always in the first week . ISO_NAME Week date representations are in the format YYYYWww-D. o [ YYYY ] indicates the ISO week - numbering year which is slightly different from the traditional Gregorian calendar year . o [ Www ] is the week number prefixed by the letter W , from W01 through W53 . o [ D ] is the weekday number , from 1 through 7 , beginning with Monday and ending with Sunday . For example, the Gregorian date 31 December 2006 corresponds to the\n   Sunday of the 52nd week of 2006, and is written 2006-W52-7 (extended form)\n or\n 2006W527 (compact form).

It is used (mainly) in\n   government and business for fiscal years, as well as in timekeeping.\n   The system specifies a week year atop the Gregorian calendar by\n   defining a notation for ordinal weeks of the year. An ISO week-numbering year (also called ISO year informally) has\n   52 or 53 full weeks. That is 364 or 371 days instead of the usual\n   365 or 366 days. The extra week is referred to here as a leap week,\n   although ISO-8601 does not use this term. Weeks start with Monday.\n   The first week of a year is the week that contains the first Thursday\n   of the year (and, hence, always contains 4 January). ISO week year\n   numbering therefore slightly deviates from the Gregorian for some\n   days close to January 1st. METHOD Calculating a date given the year , week number and weekday This method requires that one know the weekday of 4 January of the year in question . Add 3 to the number of this weekday , giving a correction to be used for dates within this year . Method : Multiply the week number by 7 , then add the weekday . From this sum subtract the correction for the year . The result is the ordinal date , which can be converted into a calendar date . If the ordinal date thus obtained is zero or negative , the date belongs to the previous calendar year ; if greater than the number of days in the year , to the following year . Example : year 2008 , week 39 , Saturday ( day 6 ) Correction for 2008 : 5 + 3 = 8 ( 39 x 7 ) + 6 = 279 279 - 8 = 271 Ordinal day 271 of a leap year is day 271 - 244 = 27 September Result : 27 September 2008 ISO_NAME Week date representations are in the format YYYYWww-D. o [ YYYY ] indicates the ISO week - numbering year which is slightly different from the traditional Gregorian calendar year . o [ Www ] is the week number prefixed by the letter W , from W01 through W53 . o [ D ] is the weekday number , from 1 through 7 , beginning with Monday and ending with Sunday . For example, the Gregorian date 31 December 2006 corresponds to the\n   Sunday of the 52nd week of 2006, and is written 2006-W52-7 (extended form)\n or\n 2006W527 (compact form).

The less often needed, capitalized,\nmajuscule letters, ended up in the harder to reach upper cases.

The fmtdate_usage(3f) subroutine displays the formatting options !!   available for use in procedures such as fmtdate(3f) and now(3f). !!   It is typically used to produce up-to-date help text in commands !!   that use the M_time(3fm) module, so that the formatting information !!   only needs maintained in one place (this routine) and is easily !!   displayed so users can quickly obtain a description of the formatting !!   macros. !! !!##OPTIONS !!     indent      how many spaces to prefix the output with, so that !!                 calling programs can position the output. Default !!                 for this optional parameter is three (3). !! !!##EXAMPLE !! !!    Sample Program: !! !!     program demo_fmtdate_usage !!     use M_time, only : fmtdate_usage !!     implicit none !!        call fmtdate_usage() ! see all formatting options !!     end program demo_fmtdate_usage !! !!    results (actually call the routine to ensure this is up to date): !! !!

The ISO-8601 date and time standard was issued by the International !!   Organization for Standardization (ISO). It is used (mainly) in !!   government and business for fiscal years, as well as in timekeeping. !!   The system specifies a week year atop the Gregorian calendar by defining !!   a notation for ordinal weeks of the year. !! !!   o An ISO week-numbering year (also called ISO year informally) has 52 !!     or 53 full weeks. That is 364 or 371 days instead of the usual 365 !!     or 366 days. !!   o The extra week is referred to here as a leap week, although ISO-8601 !!     does not use this term.  Weeks start with Monday. !!   o The first week of a year is the week that contains the first Thursday !!     of the year (and, hence, always contains 4 January).  ISO week year !!     numbering therefore slightly deviates from the Gregorian for some days !!     close to January 1st. !! !!##CALCULATION !!   The ISO-8601 week number of any date can be calculated, given its !!   ordinal date (i.e. position within the year) and its day of the week. !! !!##METHOD !!     Using ISO weekday numbers (running from 1 for Monday to 7 for Sunday), !!     subtract the weekday from the ordinal date, then add 10. Divide the !!     result by 7. Ignore the remainder; the quotient equals the week !!     number. If the week number thus obtained equals 0, it means that !!     the given date belongs to the preceding (week-based) year. If a !!     week number of 53 is obtained, one must check that the date is not !!     actually in week 1 of the following year. !! !!     These two statements are assumed true when correcting the dates !!     around January 1st: !! !!     o The number of weeks in a given year is equal to the corresponding !!       week number of 28 December. !!     o January 4th is always in the first week. !! !!##ISO_NAME !!   Week date representations are in the format YYYYWww-D. !! !!     o [YYYY] indicates the ISO week-numbering year which is slightly !!       different from the traditional Gregorian calendar year. !!     o [Www] is the week number prefixed by the letter W, from W01 !!       through W53. !!     o [D] is the weekday number, from 1 through 7, beginning with Monday !!       and ending with Sunday. !! !!   For example, the Gregorian date 31 December 2006 corresponds to the !!   Sunday of the 52nd week of 2006, and is written !! !!     2006-W52-7 (extended form) !!     or !!     2006W527 (compact form). !! !!##REFERENCE !!

The ISO-8601 date and time standard was issued by the International !!   Organization for Standardization (ISO). It is used (mainly) in !!   government and business for fiscal years, as well as in timekeeping. !!   The system specifies a week year atop the Gregorian calendar by !!   defining a notation for ordinal weeks of the year. !! !!   An ISO week-numbering year (also called ISO year informally) has !!   52 or 53 full weeks. That is 364 or 371 days instead of the usual !!   365 or 366 days. The extra week is referred to here as a leap week, !!   although ISO-8601 does not use this term. Weeks start with Monday. !!   The first week of a year is the week that contains the first Thursday !!   of the year (and, hence, always contains 4 January). ISO week year !!   numbering therefore slightly deviates from the Gregorian for some !!   days close to January 1st. !! !!##METHOD !!     Calculating a date given the year, week number and weekday !! !!     This method requires that one know the weekday of 4 January of the !!     year in question. Add 3 to the number of this weekday, giving a !!     correction to be used for dates within this year. !! !!     Method: Multiply the week number by 7, then add the weekday. From !!     this sum subtract the correction for the year. The result is the !!     ordinal date, which can be converted into a calendar date.  If the !!     ordinal date thus obtained is zero or negative, the date belongs to !!     the previous calendar year; if greater than the number of days in !!     the year, to the following year. !! !!     Example: year 2008, week 39, Saturday (day 6) !!     Correction for 2008: 5 + 3 = 8 !!     (39 x 7) + 6 = 279 !!     279 - 8 = 271 !!     Ordinal day 271 of a leap year is day 271 - 244 = 27 September !!     Result: 27 September 2008 !! !!##ISO_NAME !!   Week date representations are in the format YYYYWww-D. !! !!     o [YYYY] indicates the ISO week-numbering year which is slightly !!       different from the traditional Gregorian calendar year. !!     o [Www] is the week number prefixed by the letter W, from W01 !!       through W53. !!     o [D] is the weekday number, from 1 through 7, beginning with Monday !!       and ending with Sunday. !! !!   For example, the Gregorian date 31 December 2006 corresponds to the !!   Sunday of the 52nd week of 2006, and is written !! !!     2006-W52-7 (extended form) !!     or !!     2006W527 (compact form). !! !!##REFERENCE !!
